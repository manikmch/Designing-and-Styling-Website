                together researchers in cognitive neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational
                psychology, educational technology, education theory and other related disciplines to explore the
                interactions between biological processes and education.[82][83][84][85] Researchers in educational
                neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms of reading,[84] numerical cognition,[86] attention, and
                their attendant difficulties including dyslexia,[87][88] dyscalculia,[89] and ADHD as they relate to
                education. Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the
                establishment of educational neuroscience research. </p>

                study of education and its problems its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those
                of philosophy".[90] "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of
                education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in
                the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or
                being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims,
                and methods of the discipline."[91] As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of
                applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical
                approaches (speculative, prescriptive or analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy, education
                policy, and curriculum, as well as the process of learning, to name a few.</p>
